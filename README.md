#Welcome to FEWD DTLA 7!

This is the class repository, where we will be sharing resources, starter code, and other materials we'll be using throughout the course.

###Class Slack Channel
We will be using Slack as our primary means of communication outside of class.

Our Slack channel is **#fewd-dtla-007**, located <a href="ga-la-parttimecourses.slack.com">here</a>.

###Instructor information
Lead instructor: Emma Cunningham | Slack: @emmacunningham | email: the.cunning.ham@gmail.com

Expert in Residence: Sam Shon | Slack: @sam | email: sam.shon@generalassemb.ly

Office hours with Sam will be held 6-7pm Mon & Wed **on campus**.  Additional office hours may be scheduled with Emma.

### Final Project info
In order to complete the FEWD successfully, you will demonstrate what you have learned throughout the course by submitting a final project showcasing your HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.  You will be working on this throughout the course as you gain new skills and you will be asked to submit work at various stages of your project.

Please have a look at the <a href="Final_Project/final_project_requirements.md">Final Project specs</a> and start thinking about what kind of site you want to build for your final project -- the sooner you have an idea of what you want to build, the easier it will be for you to plan for a successful final project!
